# Project
Welcome to the Cybersecurity Attack Detection project for MLOps Zoomcamp! This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning MLOps solution designed to detect cybersecurity attacks. This project leverages the InSDN dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/badcodebuilder/insdn-dataset and employs a range of technologies to ensure robust, scalable, and efficient cybersecurity solutions. Below is a comprehensive guide to understanding and using this project.
# Problem Description
In the realm of cybersecurity, detecting and responding to attacks in real time is crucial. This project addresses the challenge of identifying potential security breaches by analyzing network traffic data. The primary goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify network events as either benign or indicative of an attack. The project utilizes the inSDN dataset from Kaggle, which provides a rich set of data for training and testing the model.

Problem
In modern IT systems, detecting and mitigating cyberattacks is a critical and challenging task. Cyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, with evolving patterns and tactics that can bypass traditional security measures. The primary issues faced are:

Volume and Complexity of Data: IT systems generate vast amounts of data from various sources, including logs, network traffic, and user activity. Analyzing this data manually is impractical due to its sheer volume and complexity.

Evolving Threat Landscape: Cyber threats continuously evolve, making it difficult for static security measures to keep up. New types of attacks and techniques can compromise systems if the detection mechanisms are not adaptive.

Real-Time Detection Needs: Effective cyberattack detection requires real-time analysis to promptly identify and respond to potential threats before they cause significant damage.

Maintaining Model Accuracy: As new data and attack vectors emerge, machine learning models used for detection need regular updates to maintain their accuracy and effectiveness.

Solution
The project addresses these problems through a comprehensive machine learning-based cyberattack detection system, implemented using Mage AI pipelines. 

The project solves the problem of cyberattack detection by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and automated processes. It effectively handles the complexities of large-scale data, adapts to evolving threats, and provides timely detection of potential cyberattacks. By integrating data preparation, model training, real-time prediction, and automatic retraining, the solution offers a comprehensive and adaptive approach to securing IT systems against sophisticated cyber threa

The cyberattack detection solution in IT systems, as described by the pipelines in Mage AI, operates through a structured workflow involving data preparation, model training, real-time prediction, and continuous improvement. Here’s a breakdown of how each pipeline contributes to the overall detection system:

1. Data Preparation
Objective: Collect and preprocess data to create useful features for training.
Process: This pipeline gathers data from various sources related to IT systems and cyber activity. It may also generate additional training data if necessary. Feature engineering is performed to transform raw data into a structured format suitable for machine learning models. This step ensures that the data fed into the models is relevant and well-processed, improving the quality and accuracy of predictions.
2. XGBoost Training
Objective: Train a machine learning model using the XGBoost algorithm.
Process: XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is used for training a model to detect cyberattacks. This algorithm is known for its efficiency and scalability in handling large datasets. It applies gradient boosting techniques to create a powerful ensemble model that can make accurate predictions based on the features engineered during data preparation.
3. Predict
Objective: Perform real-time predictions on incoming data.
Process: This pipeline is responsible for making online, real-time predictions using the trained XGBoost model. As new data flows into the system, this component analyzes it to identify potential cyber threats or anomalies. This real-time inference is crucial for timely detection and response to cyberattacks.
4. Automatic Retraining
Objective: Maintain and enhance model performance over time.
Process: To ensure that the model remains effective as new data and threats emerge, this pipeline continuously gathers new training data and periodically retrains the model. Automatic retraining helps in adapting the model to changing patterns and maintaining high prediction accuracy. This step is essential for long-term reliability and effectiveness in detecting new types of cyber threats.
5. Deploying to Production
Objective: Deploy the trained model to a production environment.
Process: This pipeline handles the deployment of the model and the associated infrastructure required for real-time predictions. It ensures that the model is operational and integrated within the IT systems where it will perform its detection duties.
Summary
The solution integrates several key processes:

Data Preparation: Ensures data quality and relevance for model training.
XGBoost Training: Utilizes a powerful machine learning technique for building a predictive model.
Predict: Provides real-time detection capabilities to identify cyber threats.
Automatic Retraining: Keeps the model updated and effective over time.
Deploying to Production: Manages the deployment and operational aspects of the model.
Together, these components form a robust system for detecting cyberattacks, continuously improving its performance, and adapting to new threats as they arise.



# Getting Started

Start locally with docker compose by running 
```
./scripts/start.sh
```

Access Services:
* Mage Platform: http://localhost:6789
* MLFlow: http://localhost:5000
* Adminer: http://localhost:8080
* Grafana: http://localhost:3000

Deploying the Project with Terraform
If you prefer to deploy the project using Terraform in AWS for instance, follow these steps.

The deployment process for Docker Compose using Mage on AWS, as outlined in the deploying_to_production pipeline within Mage AI, involves several key steps:

Setting Up AWS Permissions:

Create IAM policies for deploying and destroying resources on AWS using Terraform.
Create an IAM user (MageDeployer) and attach the policies TerraformApplyDeployMage and TerraformDestroyDeleteResources to manage the deployment process. Generate access keys for this user to be used in the command-line interface (CLI).
Configuring Terraform:

Install and set up Terraform on your local machine.
Customize the Terraform configurations by updating the variables.tf and env_vars.json files with the appropriate Docker image, application name, AWS region, and availability zones.
Deploying to AWS:

Navigate to the Terraform directory and run the terraform init and terraform apply commands to deploy the application to AWS.
Version Control and CI/CD:

Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions.
If the Terraform templates from Mage are used, a GitHub Action YAML file will be generated automatically, containing the necessary configurations for building and deploying the application to AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS).
Create an IAM user (MageContinuousIntegrationDeployer) with the necessary policies for managing the CI/CD process. Add the generated access keys as secrets in your GitHub repository.
This process is thoroughly detailed and implemented within the deploying_to_production pipeline in Mage AI, guiding users through each step required for successful deployment.
